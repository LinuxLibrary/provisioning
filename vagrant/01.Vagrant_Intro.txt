Vagrant for Provisioning
========================

Vagrant is a provisioning tool. If we are about to use Vagrant for provisioning then we need to have one of the provider.
Provider is nothing but a Cloud or Hypervisor environment. We have several providers.
 1. Virtual Box (Most popular to use with Vagrant)
 2. VMware
 3. Open Stack
 4. Docker
 5. AWS

To start using Vagrant you need to download vagrant. Go to the following link and download Vagrant respective to your OS
and its architecture. In my case i am using RHEL6 32-bit, Ubuntu 14.04. So i have downloaded for those

FOR RHEL6 Visit below links and download the packages
=====================================================
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

Also download VirtualBox with respective to your OS from the below link.
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

Now let us install these both.

# cd ~/Downloads
# rpm -ivh vagrant_1.7.4_i686.rpm 
# rpm -ivh VirtualBox-5.0-5.0.10_104061_el6-1.i686.rpm

FOR UBUNTU 14.04 try the following
==================================
# apt-get update
# apt-get install vagrant
# apt-get install virtualbox

I am preferring RHEL or CentOS in my case as I have been facing some issues working with Vagrant in Ubuntu.
I'll be updating soon on complete procedure working with Ubuntu as well.

Now let us come to the case of RHEL.
While installing VirtualBox if you found any dependency failure for libSDL feel free to install that through YUM.
And try installing VirtualBox then. You will also need to install the kernel modules which are required for VirtualBox.
Please install the following packages, after that VirtualBox package and reboot your machine.

# yum install kernel* dkms gcc libSDL*

Once you are done then create a directory for Vagrant as your Vagrant workspace.

# mkdir /vagrantProject
# cd /vagrantProject

Now initialize your first VM using vagrant.
In this case i am using Ubuntu to be installed through Vagrant.

# vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

You are ready with your first setup config which is stored in the Vagrantfile in your Vagrant Project directory.
Start your VM with "vagrant up". It will first download the ubuntu image from virtualbox and once the download finishes
it will start it up.

# vagrant up

Now you can ssh to your ubuntu box by using "vagrant ssh"

# vagrant ssh

If you want to shutdown your VM you can use
# vagrant suspend
	(or)
# vagrant halt

If in case you don't need that VM then you can destroy that VM.
# vagrant destroy
