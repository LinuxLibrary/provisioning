# Docker

***Definition*** : Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container.

- Through the docker containers we can pack customized applications which provides consistent way of packaging any application and shipping in a consistent way.

- The packaged application along with OS can be stored as an Docker Image and based on an Image number of containers can be launched as of our choice.

- We can prefer Docker as the containers are lightweight as compared to any VMs as this acts like OS level virtualization and it is open source.

- Docker communicates with the Linux Kernel through the following modules

```
libcontainer
libvert
LXC(Linux Containers)
systemd-nspawn
```
