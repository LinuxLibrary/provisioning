> There is no limitation to host public repositories in Docker Hub. Also you can host a private repository too. If you need more than one private repository then you need to pay as per your requirement.

- We can use any image from the public repositories. We can find a large number of ***Base Images*** from most of the OS as well as from the Application distributions.

- We can get a Base Image and then can customize that as per our requirements and then can also be stored in either our public or private repository

> Base Image is just like a snapshot. It can't be run, but we can launch a container from that image and can run it.

- If we want to get any Base Image of our choice from any public repository. To choose a container go to explore tab on the top then you can see some official repositories.
